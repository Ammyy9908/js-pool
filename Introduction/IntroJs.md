### An Introduction to JavaScript

'Let’s see what’s so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve with it, and what other technologies play well with it.'

### What is JavaScript?

'JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called [Java](<'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)'>).'

'Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called [the JavaScript engine.]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine')'

'he browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.'

'Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:'

- ['V8'](<'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)'>) - in Chrome and Opera

- ['SpiderMonkey']('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey') - In Firefox
